# LOTR Character Bios (In Assembly) - Also, if you could not tell, this is not actually official, so sorry.
Note: This is my first commit, so if it's bad, hate the game not the player. 

## What it does.
- prints the bios for the characters (I've heard of) in LOTR.
- Has a working loop and restart hehe.
- Trims newlines, which I DEFINITELY figured out myself 😐.
- Written entirely in the holy language: Gnu Assembly.

## Why I did it.
I have no idea. I really want to read LOTR, so I just thought of this, also I really like assembly. 
And then after I thought of it I just wanted to get it to work, and kept building on it - not that it's a massive masterpiece.

## What I learned
- How to trim the GOD DAMN NEWLINE!!!!
- How to use call correctly, very, very useful and cool.
- How to loop and restart - very easy.
- How not to go insane.

## Future ideas
- Read LOTR, then remake it with real bios.
- After that add all of the characters and let you type the name instead of a number.

## Other notes.
- I PROMISE I figured everything else out except for the newline trick

## Thank you for reading my README kind Sir.
